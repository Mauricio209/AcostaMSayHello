Reviewd by Daniel Decoito: Project works as intended. Everything is pretty simple and there havent been any changes that where learned later on. Try using string interplotion or even turning the statment into a methood. The while loop to replay the game works but has issues. Instead of having the user input something that replays the game switch it so that they have to type a specific input to end the game that way the game dosent end so abruptly.
